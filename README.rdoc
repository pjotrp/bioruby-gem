Biogem provides a set of tools for those Bioinformaticans who want to
start coding an application, or a library for using/extending
BioRuby's core library and sharing the code as a gem through
http://rubygems.org. Biogems are automatically listed at
http://biogems.info

The basic idea is to promote a modular approach to the BioRuby
package, and simplify creating such modules. Biogem creates the
necessary directory structure for a gem, and generates files, based on
templates. Biogem includes templates for parsing the command line,
logging, libraries,
documentation, tests. Also there is Ruby on Rails support, BioSQL and
FFI (for binding to C libraries).

Biogem does not reinvent the wheel, but puts together different
tools and modifies their original behavior, when needed. The tool
jeweler is used to create the initial scaffold, setting up git for
versioning, releasing it to github.com and/or rubygems.org and
packaging. Bundler is used used for setting up a predefined developing
environment.

Also Biogem makes use of webservices. Currently

* GitHub.com 
  is used for maintaining the source tree, tracking changes and
  issues. Create a github account if you don't have one.
* RubyGems.org
  publishes your software for other people to install and use
* biogems.info
  tracks all biogems, so people can find them

== Installation

=== Pre-requisites

* Ruby: Ruby: 1.9
  * development and installation have been tested on 1.9.2, 1.9.3.

* RVM: RVM http://beginrescueend.com/ is optional, but suggested. Not only can you specify the Ruby interpreter version that works best with Biogem, RVM also allows multiple ruby interpreters in your home directory for testing purposes. When using RVM, make sure to compile with openssl support, e.g. on Debian
   $ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev 
   $ rvm install 1.9.3 --with-openssl-dir=$HOME/.rvm/usr

* GitHub & RubyGems: In order to use Biogem to its fullest potential, you must create a regular GitHub  http://github.com and  RubyGems http://rubygems.org account. Why? Because for sharing and keeping track of source code we (currenlty) use github and for distributing the plugin we rely on RubyGems, the reference Ruby gem repository. To configure github and automate most of Biogem's tasks:
   $ git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname" Sets the name of the user for all git instances on the system
   $ git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
   $ git config --global github.user "user_id"
   $ git config --global github.token "TOKEN ASSIGNED BY GITHUB"

Note: another Ruby version management system used in BioRuby community is https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv but for now we can not provide support for it.

==== IMPORTANT NOTE

Rubygems will not let you install Biogem in an environment with a Ruby
interpreter older than 1.9.X. Biogem can create gems for Ruby 1.8.7 -
but you need a recent version of Ruby and tools to run Biogem itself.

Also it is recommended to install the latest version of bundler using

  $ gem install bundler

=== Download

Install the Biogem toolset with

   $ gem install bio-gem

all the required dependencies will be downloaded and installed automatically.

   $ gem install bio-gem
   Fetching: rake-0.9.2.2.gem (100%)
   Fetching: git-1.2.5.gem (100%)
   Fetching: jeweler-1.6.4.gem (100%)
   Fetching: json-1.6.4.gem (100%)
   Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
   Fetching: rdoc-3.12.gem (100%)
   Depending on your version of ruby, you may need to install ruby rdoc/ri data:
   <= 1.8.6 : unsupported
    = 1.8.7 : gem install rdoc-data; rdoc-data --install
    = 1.9.1 : gem install rdoc-data; rdoc-data --install
   >= 1.9.2 : nothing to do! Yay!
   Fetching: bio-gem-1.2.0.gem (100%)
   Successfully installed rake-0.9.2.2
   Successfully installed git-1.2.5
   Successfully installed jeweler-1.6.4

Note: the above list of dependencies is just an example and it may vary from your current installation.

== Browse the documentation

During the installation you may note how Rubygems install the documentation for you, for each library installed.
Is possible to access to all the documentations and API installed simply typing in the command line:

    $ gem server
	Server started at http://0.0.0.0:8808
	Server started at http://[::ffff:0.0.0.0]:8808

To see Biogem documentation locally use this link:
    http://localhost:8808/doc_root/bio-gem-1.2.0/rdoc/README_rdoc.html

Note: the above link must be update with your current version of Biogem
